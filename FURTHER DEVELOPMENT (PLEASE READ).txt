Further Development of MediaKeys & MediaKeysOnly

I'm waiting for the release of the final version of
AutoHotkey 2 in order to compile again the code
of both programs; then I'll make NSIS installers 
with proper uninstallers.

However, the upcoming releases of these programs 
will appear only in my personal blog:

Last but not least, thanks to GitHub for hosting 
this humble project. Best of luck for you all!
