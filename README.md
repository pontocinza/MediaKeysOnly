# MediaKeysOnly
Assigns Multimedia functions to NumPad Keys

MediaKeysOnly is a simplified version of MediaKeys. It assigns (only) Multimedia functions to (only) seven (useless?) NumPad Keys. In a sense, MediaKeysOnly may be even better than MediaKeys: it's utterly simple and straight to the point.

I love simple keyboards like the Logitech K120 and I wrote this tiny script to make up for the lack of multimedia keys for music listening. Because it has converted my inexpensive keyboard into a multimedia keyboard, and because it could perhaps be useful for other people, I decided to share it. Even my wife, who uses a Logitech MK345, loved the program, as she can now trigger any multimedia function using just one key.
