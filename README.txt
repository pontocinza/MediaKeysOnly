  MediaKeysOnly 1.0.1   [2022.10.23]
  __________________________________
  __________________________________
  
  MediaKeysOnly is a simplified version of the program "MediaKeys".
  This very simple script assigns media functions (and also Alt+Tab 
  functionality) to NumPad keys. The map of the keys can be seen in 
  the file "MediaKeysOnly.png".
  
  Because all the functions in the NumPad are redundant, no actual 
  functionality is lost while using MediaKeysOnly. The "NumLock" key 
  will keep switching between the use of functions and the use of 
  numbers for math operations and, if needed, the execution of 
  MediaKeysOnly can be paused or stopped via the program's icon in 
  the System Tray.
  
  INSTALLING THE PROGRAM
  
  The installer (MediaKeysOnly-1.0.1-SETUP.exe) will create a 
  directory in the Programs' folder and place a shortcut in the 
  user's "Startup" folder. This way, the program will run 
  automatically whenever Windows starts.
  
  HOW TO UNINSTALL THE PROGRAM
  
  To uninstall MediaKeysOnly, follow these steps:
   
  1. Delete the "C:\Program Files\MediaKeysOnly\" folder.
  2. Browse the "Startup" folder by typing "shell:startup" (without 
     the quotes) in the Windows Explorer address bar and delete the 
     shortcut "MediaKeysOnly".
  
  CHANGELOG

  1.0.1   [+] Added "Alt + Tab" functionality (Ins + PgDn).
          [*] Just like MediaKeysOnly itself, the installer 
              now runs exclusively in 64-bit.
  1.0    First release.
