  MediaKeysOnly 1.0.0   [2022.10.20]
  __________________________________
  __________________________________
  
  MediaKeysOnly is a simplified version of the program "MediaKeys".
  This very simple script assigns media functions to NumPad keys. 
  The map of the keys can be seen in the file "MediaKeysOnly.png".
  
  Because all the functions removed from the NumPad are redundant, 
  no actual functionality is lost. The "NumLock" key will keep 
  switching between the use of functions and the use of numbers 
  for math operations; and the execution of MediaKeysOnly can be 
  paused or stopped via the program's icon in the System Tray.
  
  INSTALLING THE PROGRAM
  
  The MediaKeysOnly installer (MediaKeysOnly-1.0.0-SETUP.exe) will
  install the executable in the Programs' folder and copy a shortcut 
  in the user's "Startup" folder. This way, the program will run 
  automatically whenever Windows starts.
  
  HOW TO UNINSTALL THE PROGRAM
  
  To uninstall MediaKeysOnly, follow these steps:
   
  1. Delete the "C:\Program Files (86)\MediaKeysOnly" folder
  2. Browse the "Startup" folder by typing "shell:startup" (without 
     the quotes) in the Windows Explorer address bar and delete the 
     shortcut "MediaKeysOnly".

  MediaKeysOnly is distributed under the terms of the GNU General 
  Public License Version 3 (gpl-3.0), which is included in the

  MediaKeysOnly was developed and compiled with a sophisticated 
  open source software called AutoHotkey. To the authors of this 
  extraordinary program, and to GitHub for hosting this tiny 
  script, I'd like to express my gratitude.
